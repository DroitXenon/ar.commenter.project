<p>🖥️<em><strong>Project Name</strong></em><br />AR Commenter (ARC)</p>
<p><strong>🌿</strong><em><strong>Project Motivation</strong></em></p>
<p>Our inspiration came from the LiDAR on our iPhones/iPads which. Digital education is playing an increasingly prominent role in the post-pandemic era, our team wants to become a part of this exciting process. The problem which we have identified is the lack of functional AR presentation softwares on the App Store. We are deeply intrigued how such beautiful and precious instruments have made their way into our lives, and we also lament the public&rsquo;s unawreness of the benefits LiDAR can bring into their lives such as AR measurement, AR education, AR presentation. Hence, ARC is born.&nbsp;<br />Although similar products have made their way onto the market in the past, none have had the specific scopes nor the depth our team envisioned, ultimately we agreed to create our own.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>🙆&zwj;♂️<em>Project Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>AR commenter, or ARC for short, is to provide an easily accessible platform for people to make side commentary and vivid presentations to better present their 3D model and share it with other people on mobile devices(mainly for iPad). This software enables users to add and edit directory side-note, presentation screens, and floating text boxes in the AR simulation with the 3D models that users want to present, and they can later download and share the commented model with other users with the app so they can also view it in AR.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong><br />To better visualize and introduce your 3D models in an education/business/day-to-day setting&nbsp;<br />Users are able to make comments in AR and later share to other users to view.<br />Users can add virtual arrows and textbooks for users to explain a specific part of the model.<br />Users can add presentation screens anywhere they want to display graphic or textual media to better present the 3D model in AR environment<br />This software will enable users in the field of education, sales, architecture, etc. to more effectively and vividly present their ideas around the 3D models they want to showcase.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Application scenario</strong><br />A car manufacturer can have their car model commented to display features of their cars. For example, an arrow pointing to the car seat explaining the type of leather used, the engine horsepower with a big screen in the back displaying the car commercial.&nbsp;<br />Education</p>
<p>A science teacher can download and comment on a model of a plant and point out the name of plant parts, and have a big screen in the back explaining more specific information with text and images.<br />Technical Details</p>
<p>From this project, we hope to gain more insights on the development of software and Augmented Reality. During this project, we&rsquo;d like to use Adobe Dimension to create our own models and Swift to create application structure and use LiDAR on our devices to visualize the project.&nbsp;</p>
